# Software requirements

You will need an internet browser and a text editor for this project, but you can create it on any computer without having to install extra software.

Here are some examples of pre-installed software you could use for different operating systems:

* Raspberry Pi - nano (text editor) and Chromium (browser)
* Windows - Notepad (text editor) and Internet Explorer (browser)
* Mac OS - TextEdit (text editor) and Safari (browser)

Alternatively, you could use [CodePen](http://codepen.io) to create the entire project online.
