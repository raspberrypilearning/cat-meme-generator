## Create your page
1. Open up a blank file in your chosen text editor. Save the file with the filename index.html page and remember which folder you saved in as you will need to know this in a moment.

If you are using Notepad, you need to type in the filename as *index.html* and also change the drop down for Save as type to "All files"

2. This HTML code gives you the basic structure of a page. Copy and paste the code into the file you just created.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My page</title>
</head>
<body>
  My content here
</body>
</html>
```
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved your web page. Open the file with your internet browser, so now you will have the same file open in both your text editor and your internet browser at the same time.

4. In your text editor, change the text "My content here" to say "Cat Meme Generator" instead, and then save the file. Now go back to your internet browser and refresh the page, and you should see the page update.
