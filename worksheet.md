# Cat meme generator

In this resource you will make a cat meme generator. Upload a cute picture of your kitty and add a funny caption for all the world to see!

## Create your page
1. Open up a blank file in your chosen text editor.

  If you are using **Notepad**, type in the filename as `index.html` and also change the drop down for Save as type to *All files*

  ![Save as html using Notepad](images/save-as-html-notepad.png)

  If you are using **TextEdit**...

  If you are using **Nano**...

  If you are using [CodePen](http://codepen.io), simply open up a new pen, then **skip steps 2 and 3**.


2. This HTML code gives you the basic structure of a page. Copy and paste the code into the file you created.

  ```html
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>My page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    My content here
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved your web page. Open the file with your internet browser, so now you will have the same file open in both your text editor and your internet browser at the same time.

  When you change the code in your text editor, refresh your internet browser and you should see the page update.

## Add the form
We want people to be able to use their own picture and text to make the meme, so we need a way for them to provide these.

1. Let's add a form that our user can fill in. We are going to add the tag `<form>` which means the start of the form, and `</form>` which means the end of the form.

  If you are using CodePen this code goes in the HTML section, and if you are using a file on your computer this code goes between `<body>` and `</body>`. (Can you work out what these body tags mean?)

  ```html
  <form>
  </form>
  ```
