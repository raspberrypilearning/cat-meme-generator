## Create your page

  If you are using **Notepad**, type in the filename as `index.html` and also change the drop down for Save as type to `All files`
  ![Save as html using Notepad](images/save-as-html-notepad.png)

  If you are using **TextEdit**...

  If you are using **Nano**...

  If you are using [CodePen](http://codepen.io), simply open up a new pen, then **skip straight to Add the form**.


2. This HTML code gives you the basic structure of a page. Copy and paste the code into the file you created.

  ```html
  <html>
  <head>
    <title>My page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    My content here
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved your web page. Open the file with your internet browser, so now you will have the same file open in both your text editor and your internet browser at the same time. When you change the code in your text editor, refresh your internet browser and you should see the page update.
